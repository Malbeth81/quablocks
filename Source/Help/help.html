  <a name="Desc"></a>
  <dl><dt><h3>1.1 Description</h3></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>AlphaChess is a superb chess game that allows you to challenge other players
    either in a local game (two players on one computer) or a network game.</p>

    <p>AlphaChess has a unique, fully customizable game board, you can change every single
    color it uses, the game comes with 10 color themes and you can also easily add or
    remove your own themes. You can also choose within 20 chess sets to use.</p>

  <a name="Hist"></a>
  <dl><dt><h3>1.2 Historique</h3></dt>
  <dd>
   <p>This software started has a school Java programing project and by the end of the
   course when it was finished it went beyond the requirements of the course itself,
   trying to become a real chess program. But still it wasn't complete and during
   the 2003 summer work started on creating a real chess game. For that purpose
   the entire code was re-written from java to pascal and in july 2003 the first version
   was completed.</p>

   <p>Then work began on adding networking support and only a few weeks later
   version 2 was completed. But even after alot of fixes alot of bug and crashes
   happened while playing a network game. It was a year later after the last changes
   to version 2 that started the work on version 3, in wich the entire network connection
   code was isolated and re-written. And finally, december 2004, version 3 was
   completed, using a much stable network core and alot of new features and functionnality.</p>

  <a name="Board"></a>
  <dl><dt><h5>2.1.1 Game board</h5></dt>
  <dd>
   <p>This is AlphaChess's maine window and game board :</p>
   <img src="images/e01.jpg"><br>

   <p>To start playing you simply have to click on the Game menu and on
   "Play a local game" or on "Play an online game". Left of the game board you can
   see the status panel wich will display information about the game like the player's
   names, the time since the beginning of the game, the notification zone (wich displays
   a move's result, if any) aswell has the moves history.</p>

   <p>To make a move, simply selecte a piece by clicking on it (then the case's color will
   to show it was selected) after simply click on the case where you want the
   piece to be to make the move. You can also make a move by dragging the piece if you
   hold down the mouse button and release it over the destination case to drop the piece.<p>

   <p>The cases of the game board will change color when you select a piece to move or
   when move you mouse cursor over them, When a piece is selected to be moved, the color
   of the case where you move your cursor will change to show if that move is allowed
   or not, but only if the "Learning mode" has been activated in the options. You can
   also specify the color to show at each moment in the options.</p>

   <p>While in a game it is possible to take back a move you did by clicking on
   the Game menu and on "Undo last move", you can also pause or forfeit the
   game in the same menu. In the View menu you can switch the game board view wich will
   turn the board arround to show yours opponent's view, you can also open up the
   chat window to talk to your opponent, and the games history to show the result of the
   games you have played.</p>
  </dd></dl><br>

  <a name="Options"></a>
  <dl><dt><h5>2.1.2 Options</h5></dt>
  <dd>
   <p>Here is the option window of AlphaChess :</p>
   <img src="images/e02.jpg"><br>

   <p>In the Gam tab you activate the auto-update feature that looks for new version on
   startup, you can also enable the "Learning mode" wich will show you if a move is valid
   or not by changing the color of the board cases.</p>

   <p>You can also choose in wich language you would like AlphaChess to be displayed.
   For now only french or english are availlable, but others may be added to this list.</p>

   <p>It is also possible to choose the game server to connect to when looking for online
   games. There is only one server availlable for now, so this option should always show
   http://www.marcandre.info. If when you try to play an online game and error comes up
   saying that it is impossible to connect to the game server, you should make sure that
   this option shows the right server first.</p>

   <img src="images/e03.jpg"><br>

   <p>In the board tab you can change the colors of the game board and the color of
   the cases shown in each of their state. It also is possible to choose wich case style
   to display the board with, the Classic style will display the cases one next to the
   others (without borders or gap), the Enhanced style will show a gap in between every
   cases aswell as a border for each of them (the previous image shows the Enhanced one).</p>

   <p>With schemes you can easily change all of the colors of the game board and it's
   cases just by selecting a scheme from the list. To add your own scheme, simply type
   the desired name in the scheme field and click on Save, if a scheme of the same name
   already exist, a message will ask you if you wich to replace it with the new one. To
   remove a scheme from the list, simply select it and then click on the Delete button.</p>

   <img src="images/e04.jpg"><br>

   <p>In the Piecse tab you can choose wich chess set you would like to use, 20 sets
   are included with the game. Since version 3.0.6, it is not possible anymore
   to add in your own chess sets, but you can now change it's color. The Display mode
   allows you to choose between the Standard mode, wich displays all the pieces in their
   original color (black and white), or the Colored mode witch allows you to choose
   the color of the pieces for both players.</p>

   <p>Note that the Colord mode always displays the pieces with a black border and that
   only the fill in color will be changed, so it is not recommended to choose dark colors
   or to put the same color for both players.</p>

  <a name="Multi"></a>
  <dl><dt><h3>2.2 Multiplayer</h3></dt>
  <dd>
   <p>AlphaChess is a multi-player only chess game, wich means that you can only play
   against another player, either by playing localy on one computer or by playing
   online with two computers.</p>
  </dd></dl><br>

  <a name="Local"></a>
  <dl><dt><h5>2.2.1 Local game</h5></dt>
  <dd>
   <p>To play a local game (two players on the same computer), you simply have to click
   on "Play a local game" in the Game menu, then enter the name of both players and
   click on Ok to start playing right away.</p>
   <img src="images/e05.jpg">
  </dd></dl><br>

  <a name="Network"></a>
  <dl><dt><h5>2.2.2 Network game</h5></dt>
  <dd>
   <p>To play an online game (play against a player on another computer), click on
   "Play an online game" in the Game menu, then enter your name and choose wich type
   of game you wish to play, you can join a selected game in the list, join a game
   at a specific address or create a new online game.</p>
   <img src="images/e06.jpg">

   <p>If you choose to join a selected game in the list, you simply have to select the
   availlable game from the list and to click on Ok. If the list is empty, then this
   means that no game is availlable or that one has created an online game yet. If
   an error message shows up saying that it is impossible to access the game list on
   the server, then this means thats you are not connected to the internet or that
   the wrong game server has been selected in the options.</p>

   <p>If you choose to join a game at a specific address, then you have to type
   the IP address of the computer on wich an online game was created.</p>

   <p>If you choose to create an online game, all you have to do is choose as wich
   player you want to play. The white player is always the one that make the first move.
   To be able to create an online game you need to have direct access to the internet,
   if your internet access is shared between other compputers with a router or another
   computer, it wont be possible for people to join the game that you have created,
   unless you configure the router to forward the TCP data it receives on <b>port 2570</b>
   to your computer, but to do so your computer need to have a specific IP address on
   your home network. For more information on how to do all that, contact your computer
   technician.</p>
